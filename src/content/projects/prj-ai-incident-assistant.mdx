## Context
A conversational incident assistant designed to reduce time-to-context during production incidents by correlating signals across incident and observability systems.

## Constraints
- Must be safe-by-design (no sensitive data leakage)
- Must integrate with existing tooling and workflows
- Must generate actionable summaries quickly

## Approach
- Data connectors via MCP servers
- Prompting strategy for correlation + impact summarisation
- Guardrails for confidence and safe outputs

## Outcomes
- Faster diagnosis via consolidated view
- Reduced manual context-gathering overhead

## Learnings
- What worked
- What you'd change next iteration
